////TYPES OF PROPERTIES 


////1) data properties
// 2) accessor properties 

// data properties contain a value like name proerty aove 
/// default value of [[put ]] method is to create a data property 
//// so far we have dealt with data properties 


/// accesor proerties dont contain a value but instead define a function to call when the property is read... called a getter 
//// and a functionn to call when the property is written to - called a setter 
//// Accessor properties only require either a getter or a setter, though they can have both 



//// syntax to define an accessor property using object literal 


var naam = "srini";

console.log("name is " + naam);  /// name is srini
console.log("name is %s", naam);  // 2nd way using %s, remembre to use comma // name is srini
