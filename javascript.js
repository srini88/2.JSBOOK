// You donâ€™t need to define both a getter and a setter; you can choose one or both.
// If you define only a getter, then the property becomes read-only, and attempts to
// write to it will fail silently in nonstrict mode and throw an error in strict mode.
// If you define only a setter, then the property becomes write-only, and attempts to
// read the value will fail silently in both strict and nonstrict modes.
