the problem with object oriented code...

objects separate code and prevent spaghetti ..

but the parts of a pgm Need to know about one -another..

which leads back towards spaghetti ..

the problem is dependency...



singleton and static methods...

A singleton is a class --- only one object will exist during the life time of application..


how do I get access to instance from a random location -- advantage...


Anytime I communicate or access with the PlayerModel I m making a concrete dependency somewhere in the app...

makes the application interconnected...


--- code rapidly becomes interdependent...
= highly focused on all classes working correctly...
